# Claude and Slack

We're introducing two ways to use Claude with Slack. Add Claude directly to your Slack workspace, or connect Slack to the Claude apps so Claude can search and reference relevant Slack messages during conversations.

With Claude and Slack deeply integrated, you can work wherever you’d like. Get Claude's help directly in Slack conversations, or have Claude search your Slack workspace when you need context for deeper research projects. Draft responses to critical messages, prep for meetings by pulling in relevant discussions, or analyze shared documents—all where you are already working.

### Bringing Claude to Slack

When you work with Claude in Slack, you get all the capabilities you already use—web search, document analysis, and your existing connections. That means Claude can pull context from your docs, emails, and any other tools you've connected, right in Slack.

Claude only searches public and private Slack channels you have access to. When you ask Claude to help in a public thread, it drafts responses privately first. You can review, edit, or regenerate before sharing with your team, staying in control throughout the process.

There are three ways to use Claude in Slack:

*   **Direct messages**: Start a private conversation with @Claude for one-on-one assistance with research, writing, or analysis.
*   **AI assistant panel**: Click the Claude icon in Slack's AI assistant header from any channel to access Claude without interrupting ongoing conversations.
*   **Thread participation**: Add Claude to any thread by mentioning @Claude. Claude will draft a response based on the conversation context, which you can review before sharing.

### Connecting Slack to Claude

When you connect Slack to Claude, Claude searches your workspace's channels, direct messages, and shared files to find the context you need for better responses and research.

Claude helps you prepare for meetings by pulling relevant Slack discussions, gathering project updates from multiple channels, or finding action items buried in team conversations. Use it for:

*   **Meeting preparation:** Review Slack discussions, pull relevant documents, and create briefings with recent updates and key decisions
*   **Project coordination:** Search across channels to gather status updates, identify blockers, and summarize progress
*   **Onboarding support:** Help new team members understand ongoing projects by reviewing channel history, shared documents, and related email threads
*   **Create documentation:** Formalize team discussions into documentation, pulling context from conversations and relevant background materials

This integration represents a significant step toward more intelligent, AI-powered workflows:

"Every company is on its way to becoming an agentic enterprise, where AI agents work hand-in-hand with humans. Partnering with Anthropic to integrate Claude into Slack and Slack context into Claude accelerates that journey — bringing best-in-class AI directly into the flow of work,” shares Rob Seaman, Chief Product Officer of Slack at Salesforce. “By bridging the gap between Claude and Slack users, we're creating a seamless AI experience that makes work more productive, more enjoyable, and more intelligent than ever.”

### Security and controls

Claude in Slack maintains the same security standards and privacy settings as the user’s Claude account. Workspace administrators control organization-wide app approval, and individual users authenticate with their existing Claude accounts.

In Slack, Claude only accesses channels and conversations you have permission to view—respecting all existing Slack permissions. Slack conversations follow your organization's retention policies and security settings.

### Getting started

Claude in Slack is available today through the Slack Marketplace for teams on paid Slack plans. Workspace administrators must first approve the Claude app before individual users can authenticate with their Claude account.

The Slack connector is available for Claude Team and Enterprise plan customers who have installed Claude in the Slack app. Admins must first enable the [connector](https://claude.ai/directory/597f662f-36de-437e-836e-5a81013cbfbe) for their organization before users can set it up in the “Connectors” tab of their Claude settings.
