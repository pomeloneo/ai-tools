# Claude takes research to new places

Earlier this year, we introduced [our vision](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet) for Claude as your collaborative partner that delivers hours of work in minutes. In line with this vision, we’re continuing to expand the context that Claude has access to, as well as the kinds of outputs you can generate with Claude to support your personal and professional work.

Today, we’re introducing two new capabilities that make Claude a more informed and capable collaborator — Research and a Google Workspace integration that connects your email, calendar, and documents to Claude. With Research, Claude can search across both your internal work context and the web to help you make decisions and take action faster than before.

### Research

Research transforms how Claude finds and reasons with information. Claude operates agentically, conducting multiple searches that build on each other while determining exactly what to investigate next. It explores different angles of your question automatically and works through open questions systematically. This approach delivers thorough answers, complete with easy-to-check citations so you can trust Claude's findings.

Research delivers high-quality, comprehensive answers in minutes, making it practical for the multiple research tasks you tackle throughout your workday. It's this balance of speed and quality that sets it apart.

### Google Workspace

Claude now integrates with Gmail and Calendar, in addition to Google Docs – helping it gain deeper insight into your work context. By connecting Google Workspace, Claude can securely search emails, review documents, and see your calendar commitments – eliminating the need to manually upload files or repeatedly provide context about your work and schedule.

Ask Claude to pull together meeting notes from last week, identify action items from follow-up email threads, and search relevant documents for additional context. Claude brings these insights directly to you, eliminating hours of manual work and letting you focus on strategic planning instead of information gathering. Claude will provide inline citations that you can use to verify the source, so that you can trust Claude is working from the most recent context.

Using Research with Google Workspace:

*   **Marketing teams** can plan for product launches faster by having Claude gather competitive intelligence from the web while pulling relevant product specs, positioning, and strategy documents to create comprehensive launch plans.
*   **Sales teams** can prepare for client meetings more efficiently by having Claude search through correspondence history, calendar invitations with meeting notes, and the latest updates about the prospect's company to create detailed briefing documents.
*   **Engineers** can create technical solutions that integrate with existing systems by having Claude analyze design documents and system specifications alongside external API documentation, implementation patterns, and security best practices.
*   **University students** can learn new topics by working with Claude to analyze learning materials and notes from past courses, while searching for the latest academic research, interactive learning resources, and expert explanations to create personalized study plans.
*   **Parents** can streamline personal organization by having Claude scan emails and calendar events to highlight important commitments, while searching the web for updated school calendars, local community events, and weather forecasts that might affect family plans.

### Google Docs cataloging

In addition to Research and Google Workspace, Claude Enterprise administrators can activate cataloging to improve Claude’s retrieval quality and accuracy. When cataloging is enabled, Claude leverages a specialized index of your organization’s documents to find the information you need—even when it's buried in lengthy documents or scattered across multiple files.

This technology utilizes secure retrieval augmented generation techniques to enable Claude to search across your document ecosystem, without requiring you to specify exact files. With enterprise-grade security that keeps your data within your control, Claude maintains the confidentiality of your organization's knowledge while delivering precise answers.

### Getting started

This is just the beginning of updates to make Claude an even better collaborator. In the coming weeks, we'll expand the range of content sources available and the ability for Claude to do research in more depth.

**Research** is now available in early beta for Max, Team, and Enterprise plans in the United States, Japan, and Brazil. Simply toggle on the Research setting in chat.

**Web search**, which launched in the United States in March, is now available in Brazil and Japan and is automatically enabled for paid plans in these regions. Claude for Work administrators must enable web search for your organization in settings.

**The Google Workspace** integration is available in beta to all paid users in [profile settings](http://claude.ai/settings/profile#feature-preview). Team and Enterprise plan admins must enable Google Workspace access domain-wide before individual users connect their accounts. Claude Enterprise plan admins can enable Google Docs cataloging for the entire organization.
