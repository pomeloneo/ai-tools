# How enterprises are driving AI transformation with Claude

As [the leader](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-mid-year-llm-market-update/#231d94dd-4d90-47a1-a125-c62daefe5dc1-link) in enterprise AI, Anthropic builds state-of-the-art models specializing in industries where precision matters, from coding and cybersecurity to financial services. [Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5), our latest release, delivers measurable results—reducing vulnerability response time by 44% for security organizations like HackerOne, enabling investment-grade financial analysis at institutional firms like NBIM, and helping developers at Netflix and GitHub tackle complex, codebase-spanning tasks with unprecedented accuracy.

Here's how five leading organizations are using Claude to drive transformation across their businesses.

## **How Novo Nordisk drives breakthrough drug development**

Pharmaceutical development moves at the speed of documentation—and for Novo Nordisk, creator of Ozempic, that documentation was a critical bottleneck. Clinical study reports can run 300 pages, and staff writers averaged just 2.3 reports annually. Each day of delay costs up to $15 million in potential revenue. More importantly, patients with chronic conditions wait longer for treatments that could transform their lives.

After benchmarking AI providers on clinical data accuracy, Novo Nordisk built NovoScribe—an AI-powered documentation platform using Claude models on Amazon Bedrock, Claude Code, and MongoDB Atlas. The platform combines [semantic search](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval) with domain expert-approved text to produce regulatory-grade documentation that consistently earns positive feedback from regulators.

The transformation was immediate: documentation that took **10+ weeks now takes 10 minutes**—a 90% reduction in writing time. Device verification protocols that previously required entire departments need just one user. Review cycles dropped 50% as quality improved. The team expanded NovoScribe beyond clinical study reports to device protocols and patient materials, generating complete study booklets in under a minute—work that previously took months with external agencies.

With Claude Code, even non-technical team members prototype features in hours instead of weeks, enabling their 11-person development team to avoid scaling up while dramatically expanding capabilities.

"In a highly regulated industry, we can't just throw our data into a large language model and hope for the best," said Waheed Jowiya, Digitalization Strategy Director at Novo Nordisk. "Our conversations with Anthropic guided us on how to securely use Claude for planning, strategic tasks, and code generation."

## **How Cox Automotive personalizes the car-buying experience**

[Cox Automotive](https://claude.com/customers/cox-automotive), the world's largest automotive services and technology provider, needed to transform the car-buying experience across its dealer network. The company integrated Claude across VinSolutions CRM, Autotrader PSX, and Dealer.com—choosing Claude for its performance across three critical metrics: latency, cost, and accuracy. They leverage Sonnet for complex tasks requiring deeper comprehension and Haiku for high-volume, rapid-response scenarios.

The impact was immediate. Through VinSolutions CRM, consumer lead responses and test drive appointments more than doubled. AI-generated vehicle listings achieved **80% positive feedback** from sellers. The managed services platform compressed dealer website content creation from weeks to same-day deliverables, generating **over 9,000 client deliverables** to date.

"Claude consistently ranks among the most advanced generative AI models available, and continues to push innovation forward with each update," said Ben Flusberg, Chief Data Officer at Cox Automotive.

## **Palo Alto Networks accelerates secure software development**

For [Palo Alto Networks](https://claude.com/customers/palo-alto-networks), the world's largest cybersecurity company, the challenge was clear: developers spent 30-35% of their time in initial development—precisely where the most critical bugs emerged. New developers took months to understand and contribute to complex codebases. As a cybersecurity leader, they needed an AI solution that prioritized safety and security while accelerating their global engineering organization.

After evaluating multiple providers, they chose Claude on Google Cloud's Vertex AI for its coding performance, security standards, and seamless integration. The results: a **20-30% increase** in feature development velocity and dramatically reduced onboarding time—from months to weeks. They've onboarded 2,500 developers to work with Claude, with plans to reach 3,500. Junior developers with no prior knowledge of complex products completed integration tasks **70% faster** with Claude's assistance. The company is now pioneering an AI post-processing system in CI/CD that automatically improves variable names, adds comments, and generates unit tests.

"Anthropic prioritized safety and security a lot more than other LLMs," said Gunjan Patel, Director of Engineering at Palo Alto Networks. "They discuss security implications in every meeting. As the largest cybersecurity company, that's a big deal for us."

## **Salesforce powers autonomous AI agents**

Enterprises increasingly need AI systems that can do more than assist—they need autonomous agents that can reason through complex business scenarios, make decisions, and take action across systems without constant human intervention.

[Salesforce](https://www.anthropic.com/news/salesforce-partnership) integrated Claude models to power Agentforce Agents through Einstein 1 Studio, creating a platform where AI can plan and execute on behalf of employees and customers. All interactions with Claude flow through Salesforce's secure AI systems, with safeguards like dynamic grounding and toxicity detection through the Einstein Trust Layer ensuring responsible AI use even in highly regulated industries.

Salesforce customers are now deploying autonomous agents that orchestrate complete workflows end-to-end: analyzing customer data to identify opportunities, executing transactions, and updating records across multiple platforms—all without human intervention.

This also represents a fundamental shift from AI-as-assistant to AI-as-autonomous-collaborator. Developers can customize agents for industry-specific use cases across sales, marketing, and customer service, with the flexibility to choose Claude models that balance intelligence, speed, and cost for each specific workflow.

"Through our partnership with Anthropic, customers gain the flexibility to integrate their own LLMs, introducing Claude models with diverse levels of intelligence, speed, and cost-effectiveness," said Kaushal Kurapati, Senior Vice President of Product for AI at Salesforce. "This empowers users to tailor their CRM applications to their unique requirements."

## **How IG Group accelerates marketing, analytics, and global operations**

When [IG Group](https://claude.com/customers/ig-group), a global leader in online trading, tested multiple AI providers, Claude consistently outperformed competitors across their most demanding use cases. The Data and AI transformation team deployed Claude strategically: automating complex analytics workflows, helping HR managers generate consistent performance feedback across regions, and enabling marketing teams to produce multilingual content while navigating strict regulatory requirements.

The results exceeded expectations. Analytics teams now save **70 hours weekly**, redirecting that capacity toward higher-value strategic work. In certain use cases, **productivity doubled**. Marketing achieved triple-digit speed-to-market improvements while reducing agency dependency. The company hit full ROI within three months.

"Anthropic is the only generative AI company that delivered \[results\] on time, all the time," said Olga Pirog, Global Head of Data and AI Transformation at IG Group. "For an organization driving business transformation, having a reliable partner is priceless."

## **The evolution of enterprise AI with Claude**

From pilot programs to production-scale deployments, enterprises are moving beyond experimentation to embedding Claude into their core operations and customer-facing products. The companies seeing real impact share a few characteristics:

*   **They start with concrete business problems.** Rather than deploying AI for its own sake, they target specific bottlenecks—analyst workflows that consume hours of manual work, documentation backlogs that slow product launches, or onboarding processes that take months instead of weeks.
*   **They invest in people, not just technology.** Comprehensive training programs and champion networks help employees integrate AI into their daily work. When teams understand not just how to use AI but why it matters to their specific role, adoption accelerates organically. Learn more about how enterprises are using AI and its impact on their work in our [Economic Index](https://www.anthropic.com/economic-index).
*   **They measure what matters.** Tracking concrete metrics—productivity gains, time savings, quality improvements—turns impressive demos into defensible business cases. This evidence-based approach ensures continuous refinement and proves ROI to stakeholders.
*   **They build for scale from day one.** Integration, security, compliance, and trust aren't afterthoughts. Treating AI as an enterprise transformation rather than a technology experiment leads to faster adoption and more sustainable outcomes.

Organizations like Novo Nordisk, IG Group, Palo Alto Networks, Cox Automotive, and Salesforce are pioneering this approach with Claude, expanding use cases across teams, building agentic systems that reshape workflows, and delivering true AI transformation.

**Research-driven reliability at enterprise scale**

This enterprise transformation is made possible by Anthropic's [foundational research](https://www.anthropic.com/research) in AI safety, interpretability, and alignment. Our work in [mechanistic interpretability](https://www.anthropic.com/research#interpretability)—understanding how AI systems reason and make decisions—enables us to build models that are not just powerful, but predictable and auditable. Through [alignment research](https://www.anthropic.com/research#alignment), we've developed techniques that make Claude inherently steerable, allowing organizations to align AI behavior with their specific values and requirements without extensive fine-tuning. For enterprises deploying autonomous agents in regulated industries or mission-critical operations, this research translates directly into operational confidence.

The result is an AI partner that enterprises can trust with increasingly autonomous responsibilities, knowing that the same research rigor underlying Claude's capabilities also ensures its safety and controllability at scale.
