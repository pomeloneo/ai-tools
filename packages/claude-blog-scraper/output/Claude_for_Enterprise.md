# Claude for Enterprise

Today, we’re announcing the [Claude Enterprise plan](https://www.anthropic.com/enterprise) to help organizations securely collaborate with Claude using internal knowledge.

Teams with more context do better work. The Claude Enterprise plan offers an expanded 500K context window, more usage capacity, and a native GitHub integration so you can work on entire codebases with Claude. It also includes enterprise-grade security features—like SSO, role-based permissions, and admin tooling—that help protect your data and team.

With Claude, your organization’s knowledge is easier to share and reuse, enabling every individual on the team to quickly and consistently produce their best work. At the same time, your data is protected. We do not train Claude on your conversations and content. To get started with the Enterprise plan, [contact our sales team](https://www.anthropic.com/contact-sales).

## Enterprise-grade control

The Enterprise plan introduces critical security and administrative controls that prioritize managing and protecting your company’s sensitive data, including:

*   **Single sign-on (SSO) and domain capture**: Securely manage user access and centralize provisioning control.
*   **Role-based access with fine-grained permissioning**: Designate a primary owner for your workspace to enhance security and information management.
*   **Audit logs**: Trace system activities for security and compliance monitoring. Audit logs will be available in the coming weeks.
*   **System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)**: Automate user provisioning and access controls. SCIM will also be available in the coming weeks.

## Enterprise features

By integrating Claude with your organization’s knowledge, you can scale expertise across more projects, decisions and teams than ever before.

With the Enterprise plan, you can collaborate with Claude with an expanded **500K context window**—equivalent to hundreds of sales transcripts, dozens of 100+ page documents, or medium-sized codebases. Ingesting knowledge enables Claude to provide deep, function-specific guidance.

We’re also introducing a **native GitHub integration** for engineering teams to sync GitHub repositories with Claude. Now, you can work alongside your codebase to iterate on new features, debug issues, or onboard new engineers. GitHub is the first of the native integrations we're building to connect Claude to your most important data sources, enabling Claude to provide more relevant and insightful assistance. This feature is available in beta for early Enterprise plan users today. We plan to make it more broadly available later this year.

When you combine expanded context windows with **Projects** and **Artifacts**, Claude becomes an end-to-end solution to help your team take any initiative from idea to high-quality work output. For example, marketers can turn market trends into a compelling campaign. Product managers can upload product specifications for Claude to build an interactive prototype. Engineers can connect codebases for help on troubleshooting errors and identifying optimizations.

## Customer spotlights

Early customers like GitLab and Midjourney have used Claude for Work across a variety of tasks and stages of work—from brainstorming, to streamlining internal processes to creating and translating content, to writing code. Claude collaborates with team members to create intentional outputs that unlock creativity, boost productivity, and expand what’s possible.

> Claude offers our team members a tool that feels like an extension of their work and expertise, allowing us to take on more complex tasks and deliver greater impact while ensuring GitLab’s IP remains private and protected.

— Taylor McCaslin, Product Lead for AI and ML Tech, GitLab

> Claude has been an incredible virtual collaborator for Midjourney. We use Claude for everything from summarizing research papers, to doing Q&A with user feedback notes, to iterating on our moderation policies. We're excited to keep working alongside Claude as we grow and explore new domains.

— Caleb Kruse, Chief of Staff, Midjourney
