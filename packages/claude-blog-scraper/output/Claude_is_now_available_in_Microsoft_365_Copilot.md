# Claude is now available in Microsoft 365 Copilot

Today, Microsoft announced that Claude models are now available in Microsoft 365 Copilot, bringing Claude to millions of enterprise users through Microsoft's productivity platform.

Starting with Microsoft's Researcher agent and Copilot Studio, enterprise customers can now choose Claude Sonnet 4 and Opus 4.1 alongside existing model options, giving organizations greater flexibility to select the right AI for their specific business needs.

Whether you’re building a detailed go-to-market strategy, analyzing emerging product trends, or creating a comprehensive quarterly report, you can now select your preferred model to power in-depth work. Researcher helps you tackle complex, multistep research—reasoning over not only the web and trusted third-party data, but all of your work content across your emails, chats, meetings, files, and more to deliver highly-skilled expertise on demand—and now you have model choice.
*   **Copilot Studio**: Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4.1 models are now available as model options in Copilot Studio, enabling you to easily create and customize enterprise-grade agents. With this launch, you can build, orchestrate, and manage agents powered by Anthropic models for deep reasoning, workflow automation, and flexible agentic tasks.
