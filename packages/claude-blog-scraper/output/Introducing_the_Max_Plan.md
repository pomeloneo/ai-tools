# Introducing the Max Plan

**_Update:_** _Four major upgrades to the max plan. (May 1, 2025)_

  
Today we're introducing the Max plan—designed for those who collaborate with Claude extensively and need expanded access for their most important work.

In addition to more usage, Max plan users will also have priority access to our newest features and models, ensuring you always get the best of Claude.

### Maintain your momentum

The top request from our most active users has been expanded Claude access. The new Max plan delivers exactly that. With up to 20x higher usage limits, you can maintain momentum on your most demanding projects with little disruption.

The Max plan offers flexible usage levels that grow with you. Simply select the usage level that fits your workflow, and adjust as your needs change. Today, you can select from two levels:

**Expanded Usage: 5x more usage than Pro**

*   $100 per month
*   Ideal for frequent users who work with Claude on a variety of tasks

**Maximum Flexibility: 20x more usage than Pro**

*   $200 per month
*   Ideal for daily users who collaborate often with Claude for most tasks

### Is the Max plan right for you?

The Max plan is made for people who use Claude regularly and need higher usage limits. It's perfect if you:

*   Need extended conversations to refine and perfect your work
*   Work with substantial documents and complex data regularly
*   Have deadlines that can’t wait for your current usage limits
*   Find yourself turning to Claude throughout your day for various tasks

More usage unlocks more possibilities to collaborate with Claude, whether for work or life. At work, it means you can build Projects around any work task—whether it be writing, software, or data analysis—and really collaborate with Claude until your outcomes are just right.

Often, there are moments where we want to reflect and really work through a topic. Whether you’re organizing your day, navigating difficult questions and decisions, or preparing for a high-stakes moment, the Max plan ensures Claude is there with you at every step.
