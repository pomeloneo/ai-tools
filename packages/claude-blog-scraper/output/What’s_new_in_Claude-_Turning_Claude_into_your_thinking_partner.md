# What’s new in Claude: Turning Claude into your thinking partner

Your best work doesn't happen all at once. It starts as a rough idea, then takes shape through conversation, iteration, and building. 

We’ve shipped a lot of new features in Claude over the past few months—memory, voice, file creation, and more. Together, they add up to something bigger: Claude as a thinking partner. Now, Claude isn’t just answering questions but staying with you through the messy process of thinking and building. Here’s how it works.

## Remember your conversations

A good thinking partner doesn't make you start from scratch every time. Claude now keeps track of your preferences, projects, and working style with [memory](https://claude.com/blog/memory), so context carries forward across conversations. Tell Claude you prefer prose over bullet points, or that you're planning a Q1 launch, and it'll remember.

## Think out loud 

Sometimes you need to talk through an idea before it's ready to write down. Voice mode lets you have natural conversations with Claude on mobile, for brainstorming, quick questions, or working through problems. Dictation is available on [mobile and desktop](http://claude.com/download) when you'd rather talk than type.

## Work wherever you are 

A thinking partner isn't useful if it's stuck in one place. Claude now meets you where you're working: on mobile to draft messages, create calendar invites, or make plans using your location. 

In your browser with [Claude for Chrome](http://claude.ai/chrome) to handle forms, extract data, and automate repetitive steps. And connected to tools like [Notion](https://claude.com/connectors/notion), [Canva](https://claude.com/connectors/canva), [Slack](https://claude.com/connectors/slack), [Linear](https://claude.com/connectors/linear), [Figma](https://claude.com/connectors/figma), [and more](https://claude.com/connectors) so Claude can pull in context and take action directly.

When you're ready to build, Claude can run analysis, create [polished documents, spreadsheets, and presentations](https://claude.com/blog/create-files), or help you [prototype websites and interactive tools](http://claude.ai/artifacts) right in the conversation.

No matter where you start, Claude helps you get it done.
