# Claude on Google Cloud’s Vertex AI: FedRAMP High and IL2 Authorized

Today, we're announcing that Claude models are now authorized for FedRAMP High and IL-2 workloads through Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform.

With these authorizations, federal civilian agencies and defense organizations can use Claude while meeting their strict regulatory compliance requirements, helping balance innovation and security.

### Expanding government access to Claude

The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) provides a standardized approach to security assessment for federal cloud services. With Vertex AI, Federal agencies can use Claude in environments authorized up to FedRAMP High across healthcare, law enforcement, finance, and emergency services while maintaining compliance requirements for sensitive unclassified data.

Similarly, Defense contractors and agencies can use Claude within environments authorized up to DoD Impact Level 2 (IL2) when working with non-controlled unclassified information, enabling a broader range of defense use cases.

With Claude, federal agencies can now:

*   Build AI applications and workflows while maintaining compliance with stringent security standards
*   Access the complete Claude model family, including Claude 3.7 Sonnet–our most intelligent model to date
*   Support digital transformation initiatives with frontier AI capabilities

### Clearing the way for government AI innovation

Claude on Vertex AI offers fully managed and serverless models as APIs, eliminating the need for agencies to provision or manage infrastructure while implementing AI solutions that meet their technical and security needs.

Claude's FedRAMP High and IL2 availability marks significant progress for government customers and lays groundwork toward future IL5 compatibility, which will enable use with more sensitive Department of Defense workloads.

### Getting started

Federal agency employees and contractors can access Claude models on Vertex AI through Google Cloud's Assured Workloads. Assured Workloads provides enhanced security and compliance controls designed for government workloads.

To get started with Claude in a FedRAMP High or IL2 environment:

1.  Set up a Google Cloud environment with Assured Workloads configured for FedRAMP High or IL2
2.  Access Claude models through the Vertex AI Model Garden
3.  Begin building with Claude using the Vertex AI API endpoints
