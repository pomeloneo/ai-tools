# Claude can now use tools

Tool use, which enables Claude to interact with external tools and APIs, is now generally available across the entire Claude 3 model family on the Anthropic Messages API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud's Vertex AI. With tool use, Claude can perform tasks, manipulate data, and provide more dynamic—and accurate—responses.

## Tool use

Define a toolset for Claude and specify your request in natural language. Claude will then select the appropriate tool to fulfill the task and, when appropriate, execute the corresponding action:

*   **Extract structured data from unstructured text**: Pull names, dates, and amounts from invoices to reduce manual data entry.
*   **Convert natural language requests into structured API calls**: Enable teams to self-serve common actions (e.g., "cancel subscription") with simple commands.
*   **Answer questions by searching databases or using web APIs**: Provide instant, accurate responses to customer inquiries in support chatbots.
*   **Automate simple tasks through software APIs**: Save time and minimize errors in data entry or file management.
*   **Orchestrate multiple fast Claude subagents for granular tasks**: Automatically find the optimal meeting time based on attendee availability.

## Improved developer experience

To make it easier to leverage the intelligence of the Claude 3 models with tools, we’ve also built in features that help developers further customize the end-user experience.

*   **Tool use with streaming reduces wait times to create more engaging interactions**: Streaming enables real-time responses in applications like customer support chatbots for smoother, more natural conversations.
*   **Forced tool use allows developers to instruct Claude on tool selection**: Developers can specify which tools Claude should use or leave the choice with Claude, helping create more targeted and efficient applications.
*   **Tools also work with images**: Claude can incorporate image inputs in live applications.

During our beta many developers used Opus to build sophisticated user-facing assistants. To further enhance this experience, Opus will now include <thinking> tags in its outputs, clarifying Claude’s reasoning and simplifying the debugging process for developers. Our Claude 3 models are currently unable to support parallel tool calls.
