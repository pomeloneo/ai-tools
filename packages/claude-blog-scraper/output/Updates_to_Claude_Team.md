# Updates to Claude Team

Today, we're making the Claude Team plan more accessible for growing teams. We’re lowering prices and introducing an annual discount for premium seats.

## Lower pricing

*   Standard seats are now $20 per month with annual discount, or $25 per month billed monthly
*   Premium seats are now $100 per month with a new annual discount, or $125 per month billed monthly

Every Team seat includes more usage than the Pro plan, and premium seats include five times the usage of standard seats. If power users need even more, admins can purchase additional capacity for their team.

## Built for how teams work

The Team plan gives your teammates a shared workspace where everyone can collaborate with Claude on projects and access internal knowledge through connectors. Claude Code is included with every seat—whether you're a developer shipping features or a product manager automating workflows.

Centralized admin controls and billing make it easy to manage your team. Your data stays private—we don't train Claude on your content by default.
