# Customize Cowork with plugins

With Cowork, you set the goal and Claude delivers finished, professional work. Plugins let you go further: tell Claude how you like work done, which tools and data to pull from, how to handle critical workflows, and what slash commands to expose so your team gets even better and more consistent outcomes.

## Using Cowork with plugins

Plugins work for any use case, but they're especially powerful for tailoring Claude to specific job functions like sales, legal, and financial analysis.

A sales plugin, for example, could connect Claude to your CRM and knowledge base, teach it your sales process, and give you commands for everything from prospect research to call follow ups. You define what goes in the plugin once, and Claude pulls from that context whenever it's relevant.

As your team builds and shares plugins, Claude becomes a cross-functional expert. The rich context you share gets baked into every relevant interaction, so leaders and admins can spend less time enforcing processes and more time improving them.

They're also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins) for developers. Every component of plugins (skills, connectors, slash commands, and sub-agents) is file-based, so plugins are easy to build, edit, and share. Try customizing each plugin using Claude to make it just right for you and your team.

## Getting started

Plugin support in Cowork is available today as a research preview for all paid Claude users. Start with our open-source collection, customize them, or build something entirely new.

Plugins are currently saved locally to your machine. Better support for org-wide sharing and management (support for private plugin marketplaces, etc.) are coming in the weeks ahead.
