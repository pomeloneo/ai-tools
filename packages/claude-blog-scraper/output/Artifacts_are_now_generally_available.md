# Artifacts are now generally available

Today, we’re making **Artifacts** available for all [Claude.ai](http://claude.ai) users across our Free, Pro, and Team plans. And now, you can create and view Artifacts on our [iOS](https://anthropic.com/ios) and [Android](https://anthropic.com/android) apps.

Artifacts turn conversations with Claude into a more creative and collaborative experience. With Artifacts, you have a dedicated window to instantly see, iterate, and build on the work you create with Claude. Since launching as a [feature preview](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet) in June, users have created tens of millions of Artifacts.

## Use cases

Every team can use Claude to create high-quality work products faster than ever before. From code snippets and flowcharts to SVG graphics, websites, and interactive dashboards, Artifacts help bring your ideas and projects to life. For example:

*   **Developers** can make [architecture diagrams](https://claude.site/artifacts/d2b833dd-3b0c-4cac-9e02-787cdb9d89fc) from codebases
*   **Product managers** can create [interactive prototypes](https://claude.site/artifacts/4a0dd15f-8ff9-4fde-ad32-121b1b086ecc) for rapid feature testing
*   **Designers** can build powerful [visualizations](https://claude.site/artifacts/170a0b0a-3141-44aa-a6f8-54d282029614) for quick prototyping
*   **Marketers** can design [campaign dashboards](https://claude.site/artifacts/ed827c8a-f2e1-45a8-bfb8-6e2f2dc9c94a) with performance metrics
*   **Sales teams** can visualize [sales pipelines](https://claude.site/artifacts/e7c4a70c-d1df-4f40-a784-de578ac68cb6) with forecasting insights

## Get started

Users on Free and Pro plans can publish and remix Artifacts with the broader community, allowing you to build and iterate on the materials published by other users around the world.

Team plan users can create Artifacts and share them in Projects, enabling teammates to collaborate in a secure environment. We look forward to seeing what you build and share next on [Claude.ai](http://claude.ai).
