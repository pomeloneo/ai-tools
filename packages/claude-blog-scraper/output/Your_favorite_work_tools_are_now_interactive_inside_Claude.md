# Your favorite work tools are now interactive inside Claude

Starting today, you can open and interact with tools in Claude. Build and update project timelines in Asana. Draft, edit and send Slack messages in a formatted preview. Visualize ideas as diagrams in Figma—all without switching tabs.

Claude already connects to your tools and takes actions on your behalf. Now those tools show up right in the conversation, so you can see what's happening and collaborate in real time.

## ‍**Built on an open standard**‍

The underlying technology is built on the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro), the open standard for connecting tools to AI applications. MCP Apps is a new extension to MCP that lets any MCP server deliver an interactive interface within any supporting AI product—not just Claude.

We open sourced MCP to give the ecosystem a universal way to connect tools to AI. Now we're extending MCP further so developers can build interactive UI on top of it, wherever their users are. 

To learn more, see the announcement of [MCP Apps - The First Official MCP Extension](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-01-26-mcp-apps).
